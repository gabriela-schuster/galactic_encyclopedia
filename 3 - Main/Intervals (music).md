An interval is the distance between two notes.

Taking as example, the C note

| C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | A   | B   | C (octave) | D (octave) | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | --- |
| 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th        | 9th        | ... |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |            |            |     |

> We take the intervals from C as an example, but it could start

#### Minor intervals
the minor interval is formed after decreasing half step from the major interval

C -> D: major 2nd
C -> Db: minor 2nd

C -> E: major 3rd
C -> Eb: minor 3rd 

C -> A: major 6th
C -> Ab: minor 6th 

C -> B: major 7th
C -> Bb: minor 7th

#### The 4th and 5th intervals
They can be classified as **diminished**, **perfect**, or **augmented**

C -> F: perfect 4th
C -> F#: augmented 4th (or diminished 5th)

C -> Gb: diminished 5th (or augmented 4th)
C -> G: perfect 5th
C -> G#: augmented 5th (or minor 6th)
