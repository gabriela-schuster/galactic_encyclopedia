To generate a major scale, we can follow the pattern:

> W - W - H - W - W - W - H

where W is a whole step jump, and H is a half step jump

> a half-step is a jump of 1 fret on fretted instruments
> similarly, a whole step is a jump of 2 frets

### Example

the major scale of G

| Root | W   | W   | H   | W   | W   | W   | H   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G    | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F#  | G   |
