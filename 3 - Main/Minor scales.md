To generate a minor scale, we can follow the pattern:

> W - H - W - W - H - W - W

where W is a whole step jump, and H is a half step jump

> [!sumary]
> a half-step is a jump of 1 fret on fretted instruments
> similarly, a whole step is a jump of 2 frets

### Example

the minor scale of D

| Root | W   | H   | W   | W   | H   | W   | W   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D    | E   | F   | D   | A   | Bb  | C   | D   |
